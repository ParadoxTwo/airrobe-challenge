# Scrabble 

Building this game was quite challenging and fun! I learned a lot as I applied TDD in the game.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, make sure to install nodejs if you do not have it installed already and then run the command in the project directory:

### `npm install`

## Running the game

To run the game, run the following command in the project directory:

### `npm start`

This will start the game in the command line. You can forcefully stop the game by pressing CTRL + C

## Running tests

The tests were built using jest. To run tests, run the following command in the project directory:

### `npm test`

Every test under line 47 of game.test.js can be commented for clearity of details in testing. You can asle modify the parameters for test in package.json depending on the information you need from the tests. For more details check out jest documentation (https://jestjs.io/docs/cli).
